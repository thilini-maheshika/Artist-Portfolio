# Artist-Portfolio
This is a web application for a musician's portfolio. It includes a home page, an about section, and an event section where you can add, view, update, and delete events.By clicking on the date, the Event Adding form will appear. And the material react table fetches the events, and it will allow you to edit and delete events.
Basically I used MUI for the Design.
Additionally, there's a contact form (note that the API for this form is not implemented).

01 ) Prerequisites : 
XAMPP installed (for running the server)
Node.js installed (for running the client)

Start the XAMPP server (Client : Port 3000; Server: Port 3004)
Install the dependencies for the client:

  npm install
Install the dependencies for the server:

03) Usage :
  To run the client (frontend), navigate to the client directory:

Web Application will run at http://localhost:3000.

* By using Mongodb Compass can connect to the cluster using above string.And it will fetch the database and values.
